The REALM Creative Academy is an innovative and individualized educational institution that offers a unique approach to learning. We believe in nurturing and supporting kids to help them achieve success. Our team, including directors, teachers, and staff, is dedicated to this mission, and we have formed valuable partnerships to enhance the learning experience. In the Fall 2023 Semester in Santa Monica, we offer a variety of classes, Adventure Week programs, tutoring services, and music lessons. Whether you're considering homeschooling or want to supplement your child's traditional education, we have customized educational plans to suit your needs. Additionally, we provide resources on how to homeschool, including cost information, policies, and frequently asked questions. At The REALM, our guiding principles are built upon five pillars: kindness, accountability, mindfulness, embracing differences, and supporting the greater good. Our mission is to provide creative, diverse experiences, honoring each student's unique strengths and inspiring them to reach their full potential. We love and nurture kids, guiding them towards success, supporting them through challenges, and fostering a love of lifelong learning. The REALM was created to address the lack of creative outlets in traditional schools, where an emphasis on test scores often leaves talented kids feeling disheartened. We offer versatile spaces for diverse groups of students and encourage them to take risks, explore life, and develop peace literacy skills. Victoria Forsman, our Founding Director, is driven by a belief in the potential for greatness in all things. Recognizing trends and disparities in education, she is passionate about inspiring lifelong learners and creating a new vision for education. She aims to support schools and classrooms with enriching experiences while providing a space for talented individuals to share and teach. Our class schedule for Fall 2023 includes a wide range of options, including homeschool classes, adventures, tutoring, fun activities, summer camps, exploratory learning, after-school classes, and piano lessons. These classes are taught by passionate teachers and focus on essential questions, teaching basic skills through meaningful exploration, and providing unique experiences in the arts. Our outdoor learning opportunities include excursions to places like Beyond Karate Dojo, marine biology exploration, dendrology studies, and even futurology discussions on AI ethics and debate. We also offer a variety of classes throughout the week, covering subjects like soccer, history and appreciation, improv and comedy, nutrition, physics of amusement parks, logic games, and computer science. The REALM Education goes beyond the classroom, offering engaging experiences such as drama and theatre, LEGO robotics, launchpad science, painting and drawing, woodworking, and basic logic and debate. These classes are designed to cater to different age groups and interests, ensuring a well-rounded education for all students. As we move forward, The REALM continues to provide enriching opportunities for students to learn, grow, and embrace their unique potential. We invite you to explore our offerings, register for classes, and join our community of passionate learners.
