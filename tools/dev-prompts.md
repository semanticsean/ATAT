# Email Conversation Threading and Nesting
Thread Representation:
Goal: Each email in a conversation thread is represented in a visually hierarchical manner, showing the flow of the conversation.
Represent each email in a conversation thread using <blockquote> HTML elements for hierarchical visual representation.
Show the flow of the conversation using nested <blockquote> elements.
Nested Quoting Implementation:

For each email, quote only the immediate predecessor.
Wrap the content of each email in a <blockquote> and prepend it to the reply's content.
Visual Indicators in Nesting:

Apply CSS styles to <blockquote> to indicate different nesting levels.
Use vertical lines and indentation for visual differentiation.
Implement a nesting depth limit to avoid excessive depth.
Content Format Handling:

Support both plain text and HTML email formats.
For plain text, prefix lines with > for quoting.
For HTML, use <blockquote> for quoting.
Handle character encoding to maintain content integrity, especially for non-Latin characters.
Timestamps and Attribution Formatting:

Include timestamps and attribution lines (e.g., "On [date], [sender] wrote:") in each quoted message.
Standardize the format of timestamps and attribution lines.
Performance Optimization:

Sanitize HTML content to prevent XSS attacks.
Comply with data protection regulations and ensure user privacy in email handling.
