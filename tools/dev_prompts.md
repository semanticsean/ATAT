Code Readability and Maintainability

The code should be well-documented and structured for ease of understanding and maintenance.
Use clear and descriptive variable names.
Performance

The script should efficiently handle the concatenation and formatting of email content, especially when dealing with long email histories.
Scalability

The script should be capable of handling email histories of varying lengths without significant degradation in performance.
Security

Ensure safe handling of input data to prevent injection attacks, especially when dealing with HTML content.
Compatibility

The script should be compatible with standard Python libraries for email handling, such as email.mime.multipart and email.mime.text.


The script must be capable of constructing an email message using the sender's address, recipient's address, subject, body, and a history of previous emails.
MIME Message Formatting

The email must be constructed as a MIME multipart message with 'alternative' subtypes to support both plain text (text/plain) and HTML (text/html) formats.
Email Header Information

The script must set the 'From', 'To', and 'Subject' fields of the email.
HTML Body Construction

The HTML body of the email should include the main message body and the formatted email history.
The email history must be formatted using nested blockquotes.
Each message in the email history should be enclosed within a <div> tag with a class gmail_quote for proper styling and identification.
The HTML body should be formatted to maintain readability and proper structuring, including line breaks between the main body and the history.
Plain Text Body Construction

A plain text version of the email should be constructed by concatenating the main body and the plain text representations of the email history messages, separated by line breaks for readability.
Email History Formatting

The script must include a function to format the email history.
Each message in the email history should be formatted with a blockquote for proper nesting in the HTML version.
The function should handle the concatenation of multiple historical messages, preserving their order and formatting.
Compatibility and Fallback
Modularity and Reusability

The functions for constructing the email and formatting the email history should be modular and reusable for different emails with varying content and history.
