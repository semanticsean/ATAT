# next steps 

Refactor with community feedback and guidance. Needs proper class structure, testing, and utlimately to read off of a database and accept API hooks for agents instead of just static JSON. 

Improve thread_recionciler.py and self-healing of data storage, move processed_threads.json to a db. update onboarding so no risk in plugging into older email inboxes with hundreds / thousands of old messages to index, and prevent uninentional triggering of send emails in that process. 

Build a stand-alone email constructor including handling of various client types, history management, history css. Read history from a local db that is in sync with remove server, in most robust case. 

LLAMA and other API integrations, probably HF. 

Give agents the ability to run ABE.
