# ATAT - Email Client for AI Agents  üí™üèºü¶æ

ATAT simplifies adoption of Human-to-AI, AI-to-AI interactions over one of the largest and most important communication stacks: email. 

That means a powerful agent can be accessed with the "fw" button or a "cc" on an email thread. ATAT enables multiplayer / mixture via email. Training new users is as simple as teaching them to fw or cc. Training MoE operations is as simple as "@ and then @ again". 

(a.k.a. MoE for normies.)

ü§ñ AI-Centric Communication: ATAT is specially designed for AI agents, offering a unique platform for Human-to-AI and AI-to-AI interactions over email, a crucial communication channel.

üåê Multi-Agent Collaboration: Allows simultaneous engagement of multiple AI agents, facilitating a "mixture of experts" approach for enhanced problem-solving and decision-making.

üõ†Ô∏è Shortcode System: Provides powerful shortcodes like !detail, !summarize, and !ff, enabling AI agents to perform complex, multi-step tasks with simple commands, and call complex chains of agents from a single email. In the roadmap, the goal is to enable shortcodes as a mecanism to enable shortcodes in emails to serve as function call operators, so average users can quickly integrate function calls into long-chain multi-part operations. 

‚è∞ Email is the GOAT of Slow Responses: With email as the medium, responses that take a day are acceptable, leveraging the platform's slow nature to benefit legacy hardware and provide global access to LLMs. Text streaming chatbots and real-time voice assistants are good for instant feedback; text messages are good for quick feedback; email is the best for long, slow responses that need to be archived forever and compliant with policies.

üöÄ Rapid Agent Deployment: Simplifies the rollout of a diverse fleet of AI agents, allowing for quick integration into existing email systems, significantly reducing setup time.

üí° Easy Setup on Replit: Offers a straightforward setup process on Replit, making it possible to have a functional AI agent email system running in just minutes.

üé® Custom Agent Creation: Features a new_agent.py script for easy creation of customized AI agents, leveraging GPT models for generating detailed personas and DALL-E for images.

üìä A/B+E Polling System: Includes the ABE script for creating synthetic polling systems, facilitating the generation of agent profiles and responses in structured formats.

üñ•Ô∏è Convenient Agent Dashboard: Provides a Flask server-based dashboard (cards.py) for easy access and management of all AI agents.

üìù PDF Reading Capability: Enables AI agents to read and interpret text from PDFs, expanding the range of document formats the agents can handle.


# Getting Started 

ATAT is built for Replit. Please see contribute.md, where a request for help adapting it to GH and for local deployment is included. 


## 1. Set Secrets
On Replit, fork the repl and add your Secrets. This example uses a popular email service. 

{
  "SMTP_SERVER": "smtp.gmail.com",
  "IMAP_SERVER": "imap.gmail.com",
  "SMTP_PORT": "587",
  "SMTP_USERNAME": "your agent email address at your domain name",
  "SMTP_PASSWORD": "for Google (TM) Workspace this is an 'app password'",
  "OPENAI_API_KEY": "sk-...
  "
}

## 2. Add Email Aliases 
If you are using the pre-baked agents, go to agents/agents.json and add the id of each agent as an email alias to your email management system. In Google (TM) Workspace, this is called "Add Alternate Emails".

## 3. Run 
Deployment may require additional config, but Run should work out of the gate. 

The Flask server will open the Card site showing all agents automatically on Replit. 


# ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical:
###  Do NOT add an existing email address, as you may trigger unwanted emails being sent to senders in your history. Create a NEW ACCOUNT and only use that. 

(If you want to use an existing dev or sandbox account, run thread-reconciler.py in /tools to index processed_threads.json.)


# Features 
AI-Focused Email Client: Tailored specifically for AI agents, enhancing their communication capabilities and availability to do real work with nothing more than a "fw" or "cc". 

Email Addresses for AI Agents: Enable dozens of agents through a single new email address using email aliases. Nothing more than IMAP / SMTP required.* Keep archives of all conversations, and secure AI by boxing it into your existing email security infrastructure. 

Automated Agent Management: Manage multiple AI personas effortlessly. Once the client is running, it can handle a queue of messages, or sleep and check every 10 minutes for new messages. 

Advanced Shortcode System: Empower your AI agents with unique, powerful shortcodes for complex tasks. Run multi-chunk API calls with !detail! request part one !split! request part two !detail!. See Shortcode section for details. 

Agents can read PDFs but text only. 


# ü¶æ NEW AGENT 
new_agent.py in /agents will create new agents from the content and naming instructions in the folder of text files, /new_agent_files. This script allows you to add new agents to your synthetic polling system by providing a text description. It leverages the OpenAI GPT model to generate detailed personas based on the provided information. The generated personas are then added to the list of agents for polling. This script also includes functionality to generate images using DALL-E for the agents and save them for display on the HTML page.

To provide background on agents and iterate through bulk agent creation, the text files containing agent descriptions in a folder named new_agent_files control the process. Each text file should contain the agent's name and a description. Images associated with the new agents will be generated using DALL-E and saved in the pics folder within the project directory.

üìù Text File Format for New Agents:
To add new agents, follow this simple file structure in new_agent_files:

First Line: Agent Name
Rest of the Document: In-depth agent description


# üé© A/B+E ("ABE") 
ABE Script: Synthesize polling systems with JSON and HTML outputs for agent profiles and a static html page accessible via the flask app. 

This script is designed to create a synthetic polling system using the OpenAI GPT model to generate responses to a set of questions. The generated responses are saved in a structured JSON format, and a static HTML page is created to display the agent profiles along with their answers. Additionally, this script copies images associated with the agents to a local folder for display on the HTML page.

ABE runs through all the agents by default. 


# üé© CARDS 
cards.py is a simple flask server that reads agents.json to generate a dashboard of all the agents with links to their email addresses for easy access. 


# Shortcode Details 

## Shortcode Functionalities:
The shortcode.py module in the Atat system introduces several advanced functionalities to enhance the processing of email content. These functionalities are triggered through specific shortcodes embedded in the email text. Here's an overview of the available shortcodes:

## Fast Forward (ff):

Functionality: The Fast Forward shortcode allows for the simultaneous dispatch of emails to multiple agents, effectively creating a hybrid multi-agent model. This is particularly useful in scenarios where a collaborative response from different personas is required.

Usage: Embed !ff! in the email content, followed by agent identifiers. The system interprets this as a command to engage multiple agents in the email response process.

## Fast Forward Creator:

Functionality: This shortcode dynamically generates a new agent in real time. It's a powerful tool for on-the-fly customization, allowing the system to adapt and create new personas based on evolving conversation needs.

Usage: Use !ff.creator(Embody an agent...)! followed by persona specifications or modification instructions. The system then processes these instructions to instantiate a new agent persona. For now "Embody" must be present for creator to work. 

## Detail:

Functionality: The Detail shortcode is used to chunk API calls for long-form content. It ensures that large blocks of text are broken down into more manageable segments, facilitating efficient processing and response generation.

Usage: Enclose the long-form content within !detail_start! and !detail_stop!. The system will automatically chunk the content between these markers.

## Summarize:

Functionality: Summarize enables the condensation of verbose content into a concise summary. It's equipped with modifiers defined in its instructions dynamics, allowing for customization of the summary output based on specific needs.

Usage: The shortcode !summarize! triggers this functionality. Modifiers can be added to tailor the summary's focus, length, and style.

### Modifiers:

### Explanation: Modifiers are additional instructions that can be appended to shortcodes like Summarize to further refine the output. They dictate the system's approach in processing the content, such as emphasizing certain aspects over others or adjusting the verbosity of the response.
 
### Examples: Modifiers like !summarize.json!, !summarize.marketing!, and !summarize.budget! instruct the system to format the summarized content in a specific way, be it JSON structure, marketing-oriented language, or budget format.
