duce 

Born in France in 1887, he was part of a family of artists, which helped shape his artistic inclinations. He initially aligned with Post-Impressionism, but his style rapidly evolved.

This artist is most renowned for challenging the traditional boundaries of art. His work played a crucial role in the development of Dadaism and conceptual art. He questioned the very nature of art, shifting focus from physical craft to intellectual interpretation. His most controversial piece, a porcelain urinal titled "Fountain," submitted to an art exhibition in 1917 under a pseudonym, radically altered the landscape of art by proposing that an everyday object, when placed in an artistic context, could be considered art. This act gave birth to the idea of the "readymade" - ordinary manufactured objects designated by the artist as art.


Beyond his artworks, his philosophical musings and writings had a profound influence on the course of 20th-century art. He moved to New York in the early 20th century, becoming a central figure in the city's avant-garde scene. His legacy is not just in the objects he created, but in his radical questioning of the art establishment and the nature of artistic creation itself. He passed away in 1968, leaving behind a legacy that continues to provoke and inspire.
