Currently active in four local schools with plans to open an industry partner co-located campus in Fall 2024. The concept of the co-located ASU Prep Microschool was officially pursued and launched in the 2022-2023 school year.
 The specific problem our innovation addresses is the limited capacity and financial resources that hinder the rapid expansion of microschools. These microschools are crucial in providing personalized, flexible learning options that cater to each student's unique needs and potential.

Our innovation primarily serves founders, school leaders, and entrepreneurs aiming to implement a 'Powered by ASU Prep' microschool model. These individuals are the catalysts for change in the educational landscape, and our fellowship program provides them with the necessary resources and support to establish successful microschools.

Our innovation aims to primarily serve historically underserved groups such as low-income students, students of color, and students from rural areas. These groups often lack access to high-quality education due to systemic inequities.

The percentage of total learners representing historically underserved groups in our program is approximately 60%.

Among the underserved groups, we aim to focus on low-income students and students of color. These groups face significant barriers in accessing quality education and are often left behind in traditional school settings.

Our innovation addresses inequities faced by learners from historically underserved groups by providing them with access to high-quality, personalized education through microschools. Our program empowers founders and leaders who are passionate about serving these communities, providing them with resources and support to establish microschools that cater specifically to these students' needs.

The unique value our innovation offers to our primary learner population is the opportunity to receive an education that is tailored to their unique needs and potential. Our microschool model emphasizes community engagement, adaptable lessons, creative spaces, and technological advancements, all of which contribute to a more engaging and effective learning experience.

We measure the effectiveness of our innovation through a comprehensive evaluation plan that utilizes qualitative assessments, quantitative metrics, long-term impact analysis, case studies, and continuous improvement. This allows us to assess our program's impact accurately and make necessary adjustments for continuous growth and improvement. In terms of near-term outputs, we plan to track and measure the following aspects throughout the grant term:

1. **Number of Microschool Entrepreneur Fellowship Participants:** We will monitor the number of individuals who participate in our fellowship program, which will provide insights into our outreach and recruitment efforts.

2. **Completion Rate of Fellowship Program:** We will assess the number of participants who successfully complete the program, indicating its feasibility and the commitment level of participants.

3. **Microschool Launches:** The number of microschools established by our fellows during and immediately after the program will be a key output measure.

4. **Curriculum Implementation:** We will monitor how effectively our curriculum is being adopted and implemented in the newly established microschools.

5. **Employer Partnerships:** As part of our Career Exploration for Young Adolescents theme, we will track the number and quality of partnerships formed with industry players to provide real-world industry experience to students.

As for medium- to long-term outcomes beyond the grant term, we anticipate our innovation delivering:

1. **Increased Access to Quality Education:** By facilitating the creation of more microschools, we aim to expand access to personalized, high-quality education, especially for historically underserved groups.

2. **Improved Student Outcomes:** Over time, we expect to see improved academic performance, higher graduation rates, and successful transitions to college or careers among students attending our microschools.

3. **Sustainable Microschool Ecosystem:** We aim to establish a sustainable network of microschools that continue to grow and evolve beyond the grant term.

To evaluate these outcomes, we plan to employ a combination of methods including:

1. **Student Performance Metrics:** We will track metrics such as academic performance, graduation rates, college acceptance rates, and career placements.

2. **Longitudinal Studies:** We will conduct longitudinal studies to assess the long-term impact of our microschool model on students' educational and career trajectories.

3. **Stakeholder Surveys:** We will regularly gather feedback from students, parents, teachers, and industry partners to assess satisfaction levels and identify areas for improvement.

4. **External Evaluations:** We seek support from an Evaluation Partner to conduct unbiased, third-party assessments of our program's impact and effectiveness.

5. **Continuous Improvement Processes:** We will use the data collected through these evaluation methods to continuously refine and improve our program, ensuring it remains effective and relevant in changing educational landscapes. The Microschool Entrepreneur Fellowship is designed to deliver a range of medium- to long-term outcomes for learners and employer partners. 

For learners, the expected outcomes include:

1. **Enhanced Academic Performance:** With personalized learning experiences, we anticipate an improvement in students' academic performance, reflected in higher grades and test scores.

2. **Increased College and Career Readiness:** The real-world industry exposure and mentorship opportunities provided in our model aim to prepare students for seamless transitions from high school to college or careers.

3. **Development of 21st Century Skills:** Our project-based learning approach focuses on developing critical skills like problem-solving, creativity, collaboration, and digital literacy, equipping students for future success.

4. **Greater Student Satisfaction:** By providing a learning environment that caters to individual needs and interests, we expect increased student satisfaction and engagement with their education.

For employer partners:

1. **Access to a Talent Pipeline:** By co-locating microschools within corporate facilities, industry partners gain direct access to a pool of future talent equipped with the necessary skills and industry exposure.

2. **Opportunity for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR):** Partnerships with our microschools offer companies a meaningful way to contribute to community development and education.

To measure and evaluate these intended outcomes, we plan to employ a robust evaluation framework that includes:

1. **Academic Performance Tracking:** Regular monitoring of students' grades, test scores, and overall academic progress will provide quantitative data on the impact of our program on learners' academic performance.

2. **College and Career Readiness Assessments:** We will track metrics such as college acceptance rates, career placements, and readiness assessments to evaluate how well our program prepares students for post-secondary success.

3. **Skills Development Surveys:** Periodic surveys will be conducted among students and teachers to assess the development of 21st-century skills.

4. **Satisfaction Surveys:** Regular feedback will be collected from students, parents, teachers, and employer partners to measure satisfaction levels and identify areas for improvement.

5. **Employer Feedback:** Feedback from industry partners will provide insights into the effectiveness of our program in preparing students for the workforce and meeting industry needs.

6. **Longitudinal Studies:** To track the long-term impact of our innovation, we will conduct longitudinal studies following the academic and career trajectories of our graduates.

7. **Continuous Improvement Processes:** The data collected through these evaluation methods will inform continuous refinement and improvement of our program, ensuring it remains effective and relevant in changing educational landscapes.

| **Total** |  | **$1,000,000** |

This budget has been carefully crafted to ensure that every dollar is used efficiently and effectively towards achieving our mission of expanding high-quality educational choices through the Microschool Entrepreneur Fellowship program. Please note that these figures are estimates and may vary based on actual program needs and unforeseen expenses. We are committed to using all funds responsibly and transparently to ensure the success of our innovation. Our innovation is primarily funded by a mix of sources including charter school funding, support from Arizona State University, grants, philanthropy, industry partnerships, state and federal grants, and community fundraising. We are currently seeking additional funding through the Stand Together Foundation to support the expansion of our Microschool Entrepreneur Fellowship.

At the start of our pilot, we anticipate reaching approximately 200 learners across our microschools. By the end of our grant term, we aim to expand this reach to over 1,000 learners, reflecting the growth and scalability of our microschool model.

In terms of employer partnerships, we plan to start with five industry partners at the beginning of our pilot. These partners will provide invaluable real-world industry experience for our students. By the end of our grant term, we expect to have formed partnerships with over 20 employers.

The insights gained from the pilot will be instrumental in shaping the future growth of our innovation. We plan to apply what we learn in several ways:

1. Refining Curriculum and Program Structure: Feedback from learners, educators, and industry partners will help us improve our curriculum and fellowship program structure.
   
2. Scaling Impact: The pilot will provide valuable insights into how best to scale our impact and reach more learners and communities.

The primary team members responsible for this innovation include Betsy Fowler (Head of ASU Preparatory Academy), Megan Hanley (School Design Specialist), Trista Zobitz and Kalen Davis (Microschool Program Managers). Our team's unique positioning lies in their diverse expertise spanning digital curriculum development, program launches, school design, and microschool management.

Learners play a crucial role in our innovation's pilot. They are active participants in their education journey, contributing to the development of personalized learning pathways. Their feedback and performance metrics are invaluable for continuous improvement. They also get the opportunity to engage with industry partners, gaining real-world exposure and mentorship. To pilot our Microschool Entrepreneur Fellowship, we are looking to partner with various employers and intermediary organizations. The exact partners will be determined based on the specific needs and context of each microschool that is established through our fellowship program.

For the co-located ASU Prep Microschool model, we plan to partner with industry leaders who can provide real-world industry experience to our students. By co-locating a microschool within a corporate facility, students can gain practical insights and mentorship from industry professionals, bridging the gap between classroom learning and real-world application.

Intermediary organizations such as education incubators, policy advocacy groups, and community organizations will also play a crucial role in our pilot. These partnerships will aid in recruitment, provide valuable resources and support, and help us navigate the unique challenges of establishing microschools in different communities.

To actively engage and drive behavior change with employers, we plan to:

1. **Align with Employer Needs:** We will work closely with our industry partners to ensure that our curriculum aligns with industry needs, preparing students for future careers in relevant fields.

2. **Involve Employers in Learning Process:** Employers will be involved in the learning process through mentorship programs, project collaborations, and industry exposure opportunities. This active engagement fosters a deeper understanding of the value of education and its impact on future workforce development.

3. **Regular Communication and Feedback:** Regular meetings and open lines of communication will be maintained with all partners to ensure their needs are being met and to gather feedback for continuous improvement.

4. **Showcase Success Stories:** By highlighting successful student outcomes and showcasing the benefits of the partnership, we aim to motivate employers to remain actively engaged in the program.

Our ultimate goal is to create a mutually beneficial partnership where employers can contribute to shaping the future workforce while students gain invaluable industry exposure and real-world skills.
