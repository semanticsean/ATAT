Update to OpenAI SDK 1.0. 

Refactor 

Email formatting / structure in general, quoted printable, gmail quotes, gmail not divs, email construction loop -- all needs refactored. 

new_agent.py needs to be openai sdk 1.0 and function calling + instructor 

add automated emails for daily / morning briefs / followup / consistent task list management. 

update instructions to get company name during onboarding and build profile around every agent working there / user config. 

Would love to see equivalent of custom gpts on an offline commodity box running a local model. a "slowcal" model -- slow and local. 

Fix CSS Grid 


Integrate with Assistants / GPTs / custom trains / HF 

breaking on: 

n > 1 agent in cc's 

n > 1 agent in @@ 

Profiles for each agent in flask app 

Auth for flask app access so can be private. 

Onboarding through flask app. 

Smooth out Deploy on Replit so it's < 1 minute to deploy 25 agents once the email credentials, aliases, and agent rendering are done. 



ðŸš© FF LOOPING AGENTS 

ðŸš© embody vs. creator 

ðŸš© summarize json not working consistently / should be function calling? 

ðŸš© have intermediary llm handle shortcode detection and even repair of incorrect shortcode vs. brittle regex 

ðŸš© agent confusion / context awareness of each other


ðŸš© duplicate and triplicate responses, especially in detail
ðŸš© email formatting needs to be its own class / set of tools 
ðŸš© atlas awareness 
ðŸš© create airbnb manager 
ðŸš© new orion 
ðŸš© processed threads letters / rebuilder 
ðŸš© actual unit test scripts 
ðŸš© minify 
ðŸš© centralize 
ðŸš© ff creator doesn't work  
ðŸš© re-structure extant agents when migrating 
ðŸš© update readme 
ðŸš© sender name included in information 
ðŸš© remove old new agent from gpt 
ðŸš© test all again 


ðŸš© Rendered Agents replying twice, not writing to json, not labeled properly in headers 

Certain agent instructions prevent summarize.json from working. 

Handle very large files / text 

Integrate with RAG/E (RAG + Embeddings), local or API 



ff / creator need better logic for handling multiple agents / calling multiple agents / calling the same agent more than once if explicitly doing that to be fluid / natural. 


Most important: API so other apps can sync to email rapidly. 

Rewrite ABE with function calling / structured output / instructor. 


Integrate AB/E "ABE" - election and polling generator as a shortcode / function call. 

Integrate new agent as a shortcode -> function call. 

Adadpt to work on GH and local. 

Add self-awareness of name and email to the prompt. Was buggy / don't want to pass emails to LLM model right now. 

Make shortcode detection an agent operation for detection and then write out to function call not regex. 


# next steps 

Refactor with community feedback and guidance. Needs proper class structure, testing, and utlimately to read off of a database and accept API hooks for agents instead of just static JSON. 

Improve thread_recionciler.py and self-healing of data storage, move processed_threads.json to a db. update onboarding so no risk in plugging into older email inboxes with hundreds / thousands of old messages to index, and prevent uninentional triggering of send emails in that process. 

Build a stand-alone email constructor including handling of various client types, history management, history css. Read history from a local db that is in sync with remove server, in most robust case. 

LLAMA and other API integrations, probably HF. 

Give agents the ability to run ABE. 

Integrating chain / brain tools.
